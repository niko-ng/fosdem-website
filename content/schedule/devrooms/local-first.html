Local-First is a new paradigm for developing decentralized applications and software, following the motto "You own your data, in spite of the cloud". In the last years, it gained increasing adoption among programmers for its interesting properties: real-time collaboration that can also go offline temporarily and will then sync and merge without conflicts; data ownership for users, as all data is available on their devices; getting rid of cloud services; increased security, resilience and privacy; and more.

<p>Multiple frameworks, sync protocols, P2P protocols, sync engines, Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) libraries, collaborative editors and apps, are coming to life and the developer experience is getting better by the day. <br/>
